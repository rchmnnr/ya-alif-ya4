### Hikayat Samudra [SSC6, Indonesia] 
(roughly translate to "Ancient Tales of The Ocean")

My song tells a story.
Epic story, from ~20 years ago. 

Commemorating The 2004 Indian Ocean Megathrust-Earthquake & Tsunami.

Let's break down the analysis of the song into the four parts: 
[jump to Part4 and Part2 here](./hikayat_samudra_promo2.md)

### Part 1: Arabic Section with cross-cultural reference to Japan
- **Veranda of Mecca is Aceh Identity** so the Arabic language holds significant cultural & spiritual value. 
- This section is inspired by Maqam Theory from ancient Arab music. 
- **Umi (Arabic)**: Means "my mother" (أمي), symbolizing a nurturing and *protective figure.*
- **Umi (Japanese)**: Means "sea" (海), representing the vast and encompassing nature of the ocean.
- *Despite* the phonetic similarity, their meanings and cultural contexts are vastly different. This is intended ambiguity.
- **Why Umi/Mother/Ocean Mentioned 3 Times?**
  - **Repetition for Emphasis**: Repeating "Umi" thrice underscores the importance and vastness of the sea, akin to a mother’s encompassing care and omnipresence.
  - **Symbolic Layering**: It reflects the multifaceted nature of the ocean—as a source of life, **a powerful force**, and a nurturing entity. 
  - The "Abi" (أبي) represents the paternal figure (symbolized as Sky), often seen as a **singular**, overarching protector. Mentioning it **once** emphasizes its all-encompassing authority.
  - Overall, this Arabic section presents a deep, almost spiritual connection between humans and nature: creating a narrative where humanity, as the children, looks up to and depends on these natural forces for survival and guidance.

### Part 3: Chorus/Refrain with emphasis to metaphorical lyrics
- Highlight of the Chorus
  - **Ōnamazu Visit**: The visit of the mythological Japanese catfish-like creature often associated with earth seismic activity. 
	  - Side note, Naga Padoha is a serpent/dragon-like creature from the people of Batak, the neighbour of Aceh, and has a similar lore.
  - **Symbology of Impact**: Megathrust earthquake measuring **9.1 – 9.3 on the Richter scale**, due to the interaction of the Indo–Australian and Eurasian plates
	  - The swaying *(berayun)* earth represents the shaking caused by the earthquake, leading to the megathrust fault and resulting in a devastating tsunami *(tumpahnya laut)*.
  - **Laut Tumpah (Spilled Ocean) = Tsunami**
    - **Hyperbole**: This phrase uses hyperbole to describe the overwhelming and uncontrollable force of the tsunami, portraying it as the ocean spilling over in a chaotic and destructive manner.
    - Tumpah (spill) is usually used for a small quantity of water, in contrast with the high volume of laut (ocean). 
    - The tsunami, like all the others, behaved differently in deep water than in shallow water. In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a **low**, broad hump, **barely noticeable** and harmless, which (in contrast) generally travels at the *high speed* of 500 to 1,000 km/h (310 to 620 mph); in shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only tens of kilometres per hour *but*, in doing so, forms large destructive waves. (remember previous lyrics? **Umi/Ocean** mentioned thrice!)
- More about the lyrics:
	- **"Tatkala おおなまず singgah, gamang bertamu ke Serambi Mekah~"** (When the great catfish visits, awkwardly calling on the Veranda of Mecca~)
	- "Gamang" as an adjective has several meanings: worried, anxiety, awkward. Here, the one who arrives with anxiety is the Ōnamazu.
	- Imagine that this visit is a cultural exchange between Japan and Pulo Andalas (Sumatra). 
	---
	- "Sambutan bumi berayun **goyah**, Samudra pun **surut**, ada apakah?" *(The earth’s welcome sways, the ocean recedes, what’s happening?)* "Tatkala おおなまず singgah, datang bertamu ke Serambi Mekah~ Ayunan bumi berujung **patah**, Samudra oh! **Kalut**! **mengalun TUMPAH!"** *(When the great catfish visits, calls on the Veranda of Mecca~ The swaying earth ends in breaking, the ocean oh! Chaotic! spills over!)*
	- **Goyah (Unstable) vs Patah (Fault)**
	- Imagine, after Ōnamazu arrives, the ocean plates are unstable, swaying slightly, yet still hold on. 
	- The 2002 Sumatra earthquake (Magnitude 7.4 SR) is believed to have been a **Foreshock**, preceding the main event by over two years. This is the *Goyah* before the 2004 *Patah*
	---
	- **Samudra Surut (Ocean Receding) vs Samudra Kalut (Ocean Chaotic Mess)**
	- Interesting trivia: Out of a population of around 78,000 in Simeuleu Island, only seven people lost their lives due to the 2004 tsunami despite its closer proximity to the epicentre. The elders taught the community to recognise the signs of a tsunami, such as the sudden retreat of the ocean, and to immediately seek higher ground. That is the wisdom of Smong.

I am thrilled that this song is able to participate in the contest, and I extend my heartfelt greetings to all other participants. The diversity of musical creativity showcased here is truly inspiring and demonstrates the incredible talent and cultural richness we all bring to this event. Let's continue to celebrate and cherish our shared love for music.

Okay, enough for now. Thank you for reading till the end.
