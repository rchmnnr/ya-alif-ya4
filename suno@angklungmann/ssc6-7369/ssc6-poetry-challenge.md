[START]
(woo~ ooo~, ooo!)
(oooo~, oooo!~)
(yeeeaaa, haaa~)

in the long shimmer of the Sound
May I some day be laughing found,
Part of its restless to and fro,
A humble worker of the tides
That round the sleepless planet flow,
And in the rock and drift of things -

O how the sea-weed sways and swings!
(O how the sea-weed sways and swings!)
Is it her hair - has she been found
(Is it her hair - has she been found)
In the long shimmer of the Sound!
In the long shimmer of the Sound!!~

[INTERLUDE: epic-overdriven, similar to intro]
~~~~;;---!!
----!!!;;;:::---

Do some small task I do not know -
O maybe help the mussel grow,
Or tint the shell-imprisoned pearl -

A mute companion of the waves
That toss within their moonlit graves -
Is it a king, or but a girl?

And, all the while, she sings and sings,
And waves her wild white hands with glee,
Mysterious sister of the world,
That singing water called the sea.

O how the sea-weed sways and swings!
(O how the sea-weed sways and swings!)
Is it her hair - has she been found
(Is it her hair - has she been found)
In the long shimmer of the Sound!
In the long shimmer of the Sound!!~

O tell me was this sea-weed found
(O tell me was this sea-weed found)
In the long shimmer of the Sound!
In the long shimmer of the Sound!!~
