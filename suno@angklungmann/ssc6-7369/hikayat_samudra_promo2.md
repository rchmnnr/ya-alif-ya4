Now, continuing break down analysis of the song's section: 
### Part4: Peak Emotional Bridge Section

The bridge section repeated two times in the song, each with slightly different musical composition. This is my favourite part, extended multiple times until I get the sound that representated the intended message.

- **"Gulungan ombak, beregu. Balapan! Menghampiri, daratan."** (Ocean waves roll, they roll as teams. Race!)
    - The term "balapan" (race) conveys the rapid and competitive nature of the waves, emphasizing the speed and ferocity of the approaching tsunami. Trivia: Eyewitness in one of affected village say that the tsunami waves up to 12 times. The first wave came rapidly landward from the south-west as a turbulent bore about 0.5–2.5 m (1.6–8.2 ft) high. The second and third waves were 15–30 m (49–98 ft) high at the coast and appeared like gigantic surfing waves but "taller than the coconut trees and was like a mountain".
- **"Pohon beton pongah, berdiri. Poranda! Puing dan debu, bertebaran."** (Concrete-trees that stand proudly. Destructed! Rubble and dust, scattered.)
    - "Pohon beton" (concrete trees) symbolizes the sturdy, immovable properties of buildings, that stood proudly ("Pongah"), which ultimately fall like trees in a forest when faced with the overwhelming force of nature (Of course the actual trees in the forest fall down too). The "proudly" here in the sense of negative connotation, maybe the more fitting translation is: "boldly", they forget the nature of the ocean as their mother (_see my 1st promotion_ to know more about "umi" **(أمي)** as Arabic for mother & "umi" **(海)** as Japanese for ocean).
- **"Manusia lelah, berlari. Terpana! ilhamlah kalbu, kesadaran."** (Tired people, running. Stunned! Inspire came to the heart, feeling of awareness.)
    - Several amateur video footage showing thousands people running to reach the higher ground, even if they tired, survival instinct kicked in. As they running the conscience arise within their heart's (here I use **"kalbu"** borrowed term from Arabic abstract concept, instead of "hati" in the biological sense, similar to Japanese multi-meaning of **"kokoro"**
- **Manusia jengah, berseteru. Gencatan! Tabah menangisi, pemakaman.** (People are fed up with shame, infighting. {now, it's time to} Ceasefire! Perseverance while crying, at the funeral.)
    - This tell about the urge of locals to reach ceasefire for their prolonged infighting, thank's to "kalbu" conscience mentioned before. Forget all difference between us, it's time to brave the heart (**preserverance**, "tabah" borrowed term from Arab concept) holding back tears, mourn for >200k brothers around the world.

### Part1: Encrypted Verse 
This section simply served as time & place of the actual events:
- **Pulo Andalas**, nickname for Sumatra, with Pulo is Acehnese for "island" (slighty different with formal Bahasa Indonesia: "pulau"). 
- **Purnama**, full-moon, this is the marker for timestamp encryption. Moon only appear at night, the actual event began at: 26 Dec 2004, 7:58 a.m. WIB (UTC+7)
- **nyaris jam delapan, tanggal empat-belas… abad lima-belas, warsa dua lima. bulan ke-sebelas, …** (almost 8 o'clock, the date is 14th… the 15th century, the year of 25.  the 11th month). 

Thank you for reading till the end.
